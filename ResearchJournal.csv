left,Rafael Lozano-Hemmer,"from Mexico, 1967—","Lozano-Hemmer is renowned for his large-scale interactive installations that merge architecture, performance art, and technology. He frequently employs robotic lights, digital fountains, computerized surveillance, and telematic networks to create immersive experiences that engage audiences on both sensory and emotional levels.
His installations have been exhibited globally, including at prestigious venues such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Tate Modern in London. One of his most famous works, Pulse Room (2006), features a space filled with incandescent light bulbs that flash to the beat of a viewer’s heart. This work is particularly creative in the way it transforms individual human presence into a visible, collective rhythm, making the participants’ bodies part of the installation itself.
Lozano-Hemmer’s work is highly influential, as he demonstrates how cold data—such as heartbeats and voices—can be transformed into emotionally resonant and poetic experiences. While I may not have the resources to create installations on such a large scale, his approach to humanizing technology is particularly inspiring to me. It encourages me to think about how I might design smaller-scale interactive experiences that still evoke emotional engagement. For example, I could build a machine that transforms audiences’ spoken wishes into digital letters, which are then visually piled up on a screen (I did include this for my Week 9 sketches). When a user clicks on the screen, they could open and read these wishes, creating a collective digital space for personal expression.",https://design-milk.com/images/2022/09/Rafael_Lozano-Hemmer_Pace_01.jpg,,"Paulse Room, 2006",,https://www.lozano-emmer.com/pulse_room.php,"InstallationArt, Artist, InteractiveArt, TateModern",
left,Anouk Wipprecht,"From Netherland, 1985 ---","Wipprecht is best known for her innovative fusion of fashion and technology, a field often referred to as “Fashion Tech.” She frequently integrates robotics, artificial intelligence, and interactive systems into her clothing designs. By embedding sensors and microcontrollers into garments, she explores how clothing can facilitate and augment interactions between individuals and their surroundings, turning garments into active, responsive interfaces.
One of her most renowned works, Smoke Dress (2016), is a garment that emits a veil of smoke when someone enters the wearer’s personal space, serving as a commentary on privacy, consent, and social boundaries. This work transforms fashion into an interactive shield, emphasizing the role of clothing not just as an aesthetic object, but as a medium for social communication and personal agency.
This work closely resonates with my idea of “Jay-An’s Social Distance Kits,” as both projects aim to encourage people to maintain respectful social distances. Wipprecht’s use of sensors and microcontrollers to detect proximity and trigger a response (smoke) is an excellent example of how I might apply Arduino and various components to realize my project. Additionally, her choice of materials—using polyamide and 3D printing to create both structural support and comfort—is particularly inspiring, reminding me that material selection will play a crucial role in the design and functionality of my Social Distance Kits. It encourages me to explore how materials and technology can work together to create both functional and expressive wearable designs.",https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/56eb27558a65e2c2a033b13c/1464624555354-ZHRF12YFV7TF9Z7695BR/masterclass-with-fashiontech-specialist-anouk-wipprecht.jpg?format=1000w,,Smoke Dress (2016),,https://www.anoukwipprecht.nl/bio,"SmokeDress, MediaArtist, CyberneticCouture",
left,Julius Von Bismark,"From Germany, 1983 —","Von Bismarck’s work interrogates human perception and our relationship with nature, often deconstructing familiar objects to challenge societal norms and cultural narratives. His practice is typically interdisciplinary and conceptual, frequently involving collaborations with scientists, programmers, and designers, and utilizing scientific tools as part of his artistic process. A major theme present in his work is the subversive use of technology, particularly in how he challenges media manipulation, authorship, and the ways technology shapes our realities.
One work that particularly inspires me is Public Face (2010), a large-scale interactive public art installation that features a giant mechanical smiley face, positioned high above public spaces. The face changes its expression in real-time based on emotional analysis of passersby, effectively visualizing the collective mood in public spaces.
I find Public Face closely connected to my own Arduino project idea, “The Happiness Score Machine”, where users can enter their happiness score on a scale of 1–10, and the machine calculates the average score and displays a corresponding emoji. Von Bismarck’s work inspires me by demonstrating how invisible data, such as emotions, can be transformed into visual forms, making the intangible tangible and adding new layers of meaning to data-driven artworks. It also reminds me of the concepts of data visualization we explored in Week 6, encouraging me to think critically about how data can not only inform but also emotionally engage audiences through visual storytelling.",https://designclarity.net/files/design-clarity_an-urban-emoticon-that-measures-the-happiness-of-cities_srn13n81xh-scaled.jpg,,Public Face (2010),,https://juliusvonbismarck.com/bank/,"InstallationArt,  PublicArt, Technology",

left,Casey Reas,"From The USA, 1972—","Reas is renowned for his influential role in the field of generative and software-based art. His work often explores the interplay between order and chaos, employing algorithms and chance operations to generate complex, evolving images.
One of his notable works, It Doesn’t Exist (In Any Other Form) (2023), explores digital and generative art forms through videos, plotter drawings, and woodblock prints. This creates a striking combination of varied colors, patterns, and textures, showcasing the dynamic interaction between different mediums.
By engaging with Reas’s creative coding processes and algorithms, I have come to appreciate how his work reveals the dual nature of code: it can be both predictable and unpredictable. Many of his pieces demonstrate a balance between randomness and logical patterns, where the outputs seem spontaneous yet are bound by rules. This reminds me of my experiences using p5.js, where functions like random() introduce chance, yet variables are still manually controlled to maintain structure. Inspired by this approach, I would like to create an artwork that invites audiences to experience both predictability and unpredictability, allowing them to explore the tension between chance and control within generative systems.",https://www.bitforms.art/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/rgb_bench_w.jpg,,It Doesn’t Exist (In Any Other Form) (2023),,https://reas.com/,"GenerativeArt, SoftwareArt, CreativeCoding",
left,Suraj Barthy,"From India, based in Brooklyn","Barthy, as a media artist, often explores how people leave traces across time. His practice blends technology, memory, and cultural heritage with physical computing, textiles, code, and video to create deeply participatory installations. His work is often rooted in personal storytelling, drawing inspiration from his own family background and experiences.
One of his most notable works, Fabric of Time, is an interactive installation that invites participants to weave a line on a loom. As they do, a camera captures their face, which is then displayed through rotating jacquard cards, alongside images of previous participants. This process creates a collective tapestry of faces, symbolizing the interconnectedness of individuals across time and space.
Barthy’s work inspires me through its deeply personal and sentimental approach, showing how interactive media can evoke intimacy and emotional resonance. It also reminds me of a work I encountered before, where an artist created a robotic typewriter powered by AI trained on her grandfather’s letters, allowing the robot to continue writing letters in his style even after his passing. This piece, much like Barthy’s, demonstrates how technology can be used to preserve memories and create heartwarming experiences.

left,Kathleen McDermott ,"From NYC, birth is unknown","McDermott often explores the intersection of wearable technology, urban intervention, and feminist design. She frequently uses simple and low-cost electronics, such as Arduino, to build her designs. Aesthetically, her works often embrace a handmade quality, valuing imperfection and function over sleek design. Her devices are often satirical, such as a dress that inflates to push people away, or a helmet that blocks social interaction.
Her Urban Armor Series (2013) is considered one of her most iconic works. This project consists of wearable devices designed to assist women in navigating urban public spaces. Key pieces include a Personal Space Dress, which inflates when someone comes too close, creating a physical barrier, and an Escape Helmet that blocks out noise and visuals to create a sense of privacy in public.
Her work is highly relevant to my project, as it directly aligns with my “Social Distance Kits” idea, where wearables are used to enforce personal space boundaries. McDermott's projects also demonstrate how simple sensors and Arduino microcontrollers can be used to create powerful social commentary. Moreover, her work resonates with my approach in its use of humor and proves that small, DIY-scale wearable devices can be conceptually strong art projects, not just large-scale installations.","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,c_fit,w_1920,q_auto/wp-cms/uploads/2014/05/3030424-poster-p-psdress1.jpg",,Urban Armor Series (2013),,https://www.kthartic.com/index.php/wearables/urban-armor-2/,"WearableTechnology, FeministTechnology, InteractiveArt",
